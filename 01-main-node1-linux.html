        𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐮𝐬   :   prometheius  is  a metrics moinitoring and alerting tool   

Graphite ,  infloxdb , wagios ,  sensu , opentsdb are similar tools  

Prometheus will track every resources of os and minitor 

It follows  real time  monitoring or container  monitoring  

In monitoring it collects  data in Two ways   1.𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐬   2. 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬

prometheus collects data from a program running in Os  and such program is called 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 

The prometheus   use http / https    protocol  to pull   the data from  any resource of os sucha as Docker , k8s , cpu  and etc

The Agent program is a Node exporter 

prometheus  store  the data in a  Time Sequence  data Base   (TSDB)   in a row format  which is difficult  in retrieving  data 
      for such reason it gives capability  of analyzing  the data  stored in database

Promql  is the language used to analyze the database  

whenever  we install  prometheus in OS  is said  prometheus server

Launch Instance -  prometheus server  , all traffic   , connect to instance 
      
      from prometheus  document  choose the type of instance/os  

copy url to download ,  wget <url>  
  
  tar -xvzf  <file>  
  cd <file>
  ./prometheus
  
  Ip:9090   -  to access to webpage
  
  
  
          Docker  TG1  
          mysql TG2              --------------------------         Prometheus server  
          node/linux TG3
  
  
  
  
  
  Connecting  Node / target  linux  to prometheus   
  
 
  Launch an instance  - > target  Linux 1
  
  In prometheus document    -> choose node  exporter
  
    wget <url>
  
    tar -xvzf  <file>
    cd <file>
    ./nodeexporter
  
    pubIp:9100
  
  click on metrics to get the data 
  
    netstat -tnlp      - status & port  of service 
  
  pgrep  prometheus  - gives PID
  
  vim prometheus.yml 
  
    copy the lines of job and targets  paste and update the ip's  and port's  of targets 
  
  kill -9  <PID>  
  
  ./prometheus
  
  check the webpage then we get monitoring data of target node in addition to server instance 
  
  
  kill  -HUP  `pgrep prometheus`    -  for restarting instead killing and starting again
