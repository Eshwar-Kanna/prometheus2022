Prometheus stores the data  mentioning the time at instant  in series format such that the data base  is said to be Time series data base

pulling the data from OS /Agent is known as Scrapping

In prometheus server    
        prometheus.yml

                update Ip's  , port  of target  jobs / Nodes  
                restart the service  (  &  is added to make server run in background and provide shell for further commands  )

      start node service in  target linux

launch an instance   --------->    targetlinux-2

      download node-exporter     ,  unzip  and start  service


In prometheus server instance

      vim  prometheus.yml

              job_name: "linuxnode2"
              static_configs:
                  - targets : ["IP:port"]
                    labels :
                          region: "US"
                          team: "team1"
                          env: "prod"




restart program   after  updating file 

Add labels to job  "linuxnode1"   ---->    IN  ,  web   ,  test



pgrep prometheus     ------    for PID

kill -HUP  `pgrep prometheus`         -------  to restart service

Launch an instance   --------   dockerforprom    ---   all traffic

docker has inbuilt program  taht export  metrics  

          vim /etc/docker/daemon.json

                    {"metrics-addr" : "0.0.0.0:9323" ,
                              "experimental" : true }

          systemctl restart docker


To access webpage  <Ip:port>/metrics
  
  In the prometheus.yml   file  add the job of docker 
  
    with target as  ["IP:9323"]   ,  labels  as  IN , docker  , dev
  
  
        pull  the images  and launch the containers   we can see all the info in the metrics  of docker target 
  
  we can write a query in query search box  to get metrics of reasources of  a particular target
  
          ex : engine-daemon-containers-states-containers      and   Execute
  
  the above query gives metrics of container
  
  
  to filter search  we add  {  state : "running" }
